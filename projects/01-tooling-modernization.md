# Project: Tooling Modernization

## Overview
Modernize the development tooling and configuration management for the Discord bot project by migrating to uv for Python environment management, implementing a structured TOML-based configuration system, and adding quality development tools.

## Context
- **Current State**: Using virtualenv + pip, scattered configuration in samconfig.toml, no linting/formatting tools
- **Target State**: Modern Python tooling with uv, centralized config management, dev/prod environments, quality tools
- **Scope**: Tooling and configuration only - no package restructuring or major dependency changes
- **Branch**: All changes to be made on `rework-202509` branch

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Migrate from virtualenv/pip to uv for environment management
- [ ] Create config.toml with default settings (AWS profile, region, Parameter Store paths)
- [ ] Create config-local.toml for developer overrides (gitignored)
- [ ] Support dev/prod environments in configuration
- [ ] Deploy script accepts environment parameter (defaults to dev)
- [ ] Preserve existing AWS Parameter Store secret paths in config

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Convert requirements.txt to pyproject.toml with dev/prod dependency groups
- [ ] Update to latest compatible dependency versions
- [ ] Add development tools: ruff, mypy, pytest-cov, pre-commit
- [ ] Config files located in invasions/ directory
- [ ] Deploy script can generate samconfig.toml from config settings

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] All configuration type-safe and validated
- [ ] Clear documentation for setup and usage
- [ ] Backward compatibility with existing deployment process

## Tasks
### Phase 1: Python Environment Migration
- [x] Create pyproject.toml with project metadata
- [x] Migrate dependencies from requirements.txt (update to latest)
- [x] Set up dev dependency group (ruff, mypy, pytest-cov, pre-commit)
- [x] Set up prod dependency group (runtime dependencies)
- [x] Test uv environment creation and dependency installation (NO TEST EXECUTION)
- [x] **REVIEW POINT**: User review and approval of Phase 1 changes
- [x] **COMMIT**: Add and commit Phase 1 changes

### Phase 2: Configuration System
- [x] Design config.toml schema (AWS settings, environments, Parameter Store paths)
- [x] Create default config.toml with dev/prod sections
- [x] Create config-local.toml template
- [x] Add config-local.toml to .gitignore
- [x] Create simple config loading module (no pydantic for now)
- [x] **REVIEW POINT**: User review and approval of Phase 2 changes
- [x] **COMMIT**: Add and commit Phase 2 changes

### Phase 3: Development Tools Setup
- [x] Configure ruff for linting and formatting
- [x] Configure mypy for type checking
- [x] Set up pre-commit hooks
- [x] Configure pytest coverage reporting
- [x] Update development documentation
- [x] **REVIEW POINT**: User review and approval of Phase 3 changes
- [x] **COMMIT**: Add and commit Phase 3 changes

### Phase 4: Deployment Integration
- [x] Add environment parameter support to deploy.sh (dev|prod, defaults to dev)
- [x] Update hardcoded variables to use config system via Python helper
- [x] Modify _init() function to generate samconfig.toml from config.toml
- [x] Update AWS_PROFILE and STACK_NAME derivation from config
- [x] Test config integration without running deployment (NO TEST EXECUTION)
- [x] Document new deployment process with environment switching
- [x] **REVIEW POINT**: User review and approval of Phase 4 changes
- [x] **COMMIT**: Add and commit Phase 4 changes

### Phase 5: New AWS Account Deployment
- [x] Update config-local.toml with new AWS account profile
- [x] Test deployment to new account
- [x] Verify all components work in new environment
- [x] Improve pre-commit hooks with cfn-lint for CloudFormation templates
- [x] **REVIEW POINT**: User review and approval of Phase 5 changes
- [x] **COMMIT**: Add and commit Phase 5 changes

## Files/Areas Involved
- `invasions/pyproject.toml` - New project configuration
- `invasions/config.toml` - Default configuration
- `invasions/config-local.toml` - Local overrides (template)
- `invasions/deploy.sh` - Deployment script
- `.gitignore` - Add config-local.toml
- `invasions/src/` - New config loading module
- `requirements.txt` - Remove after migration
- Development tool configs (ruff.toml, mypy.ini, .pre-commit-config.yaml)

## Success Criteria
- [x] Can create environment with `uv sync`
- [x] Linting and formatting work with `uv run ruff`
- [x] Type checking works with `uv run mypy`
- [x] Tests run with coverage reporting
- [x] Deploy script works for both dev and prod
- [x] Successful deployment to new AWS account
- [x] All existing functionality preserved

## Dependencies
- uv installed on development machine
- Access to new AWS account with configured profile

## Risks & Considerations
- Dependency version updates might introduce breaking changes
- Configuration changes might affect SAM deployment
- Need to ensure Lambda layer compatibility is maintained
- Must preserve existing Parameter Store integration
- **CRITICAL**: Do not execute tests during this project as they may impact production systems

## Notes
- Keep package structure unchanged for now (future project)
- No pydantic migration in this project (future project)
- Focus on tooling and config management foundations
- Ensure all team members can easily set up development environment
