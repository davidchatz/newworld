# Project: Code Quality Foundation

## Overview
Modernize the `irus` package with type safety, comprehensive testing, and improved architecture to establish a solid foundation for future development. Convert core models to Pydantic, implement modern testing patterns, and improve code organization while maintaining Lambda layer compatibility.

## Context
- **Current State**: Mixed dataclasses/plain classes, limited type hints, sparse test coverage
- **Target State**: Pydantic models with full type safety, comprehensive test suite with mocking, clean architecture
- **Scope**: Focus on `src/layer/irus` package - Lambda functions addressed later
- **Branch**: All changes to be made on branch `rework-202509`

- [ ] Type checking passes with mypy
- [ ] Lambda layer deployment remains functional
- [ ] Clear patterns established for future development

## Dependencies
- Completed environment-aware resource naming (Project 02)
- Modern tooling foundation established (Project 01)
- Access to AWS services for integration testing
- Understanding of current model usage patterns

## Architecture Decision: Repository Pattern

### Problem
The current architecture has models tightly coupled to AWS resources:
- Models import `environ.py` → AWS resource initialization at import time
- Direct AWS calls in model methods (`table.put_item()`, `table.get_item()`)
- Impossible to unit test without AWS credentials and resources
- Violates Dependency Inversion Principle

### Solution: Repository Pattern
- **Pure Models**: Pydantic models with only data validation, no AWS calls
- **Repository Layer**: Separate classes handle all database operations
- **Dependency Injection**: Repositories can be mocked for testing
- **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns

### Benefits
- **Testable**: Models become pure data objects, easily unit tested
- **Maintainable**: Clear separation between data and persistence logic
- **Future-proof**: Easy to swap DynamoDB for other storage solutions
- **AWS SDK v2 Ready**: Isolated changes when AWS APIs evolve

## Risks & Considerations
- Large refactor could introduce subtle bugs - comprehensive testing essential
- Pydantic may change serialization behavior - validate carefully
- Performance impact of Pydantic validation in Lambda environment
- Breaking changes to internal APIs require careful coordination
- **CRITICAL**: Maintain backward compatibility for Lambda functions during transition
- **NEW**: Repository pattern adds indirection - ensure performance testing
- **NEW**: More complex dependency management - document injection patterns

## Notes
- Focus on `irus` package only - Lambda functions updated in future project
- Prioritize models over services - establish patterns then apply consistently
- Use modern Python patterns (3.11+ features where beneficial)
- Consider async patterns for future AWS SDK v2 migration
- Document architectural decisions for future team members

## Phase 3E: DynamoDB Integration Validation ✅ COMPLETED

**Objective**: Validate repository pattern with real DynamoDB before service layer refactoring

### Achievements:

#### 1. **Integration Test Infrastructure**
- **Dynamic Resource Discovery**: Created SAM-based AWS resource discovery for environment-agnostic testing
- **Configuration System**: Built flexible test configuration supporting dev/prod environments
- **Files**: `tests/integration/conftest.py` - Discovers DynamoDB tables, S3 buckets, Step Functions via SAM CLI

#### 2. **DynamoDB Validation Tests**
- **Comprehensive CRUD Testing**: All repositories tested against real AWS DynamoDB
- **Data Serialization**: Validated Pydantic ↔ DynamoDB compatibility
- **Key Pattern Verification**: Confirmed repository key formats match existing data structure
- **Files**: `tests/integration/test_dynamodb_integration.py` - 6 focused integration tests

#### 3. **Model Enhancement: Faction Colors**
- **User Experience Improvement**: Changed member faction from names to intuitive colors:
  - `covenant` → `yellow` (Holy/Light theme)
  - `marauders` → `green` (Nature/War theme)
  - `syndicate` → `purple` (Arcane/Science theme)
- **Backward Compatibility**: No DynamoDB schema changes required
- **Files**: Updated `src/layer/irus/models/member.py` and all related tests

#### 4. **Test Coverage Expansion**
- **Unit Tests**: 40 tests covering all repository CRUD operations with mocks
- **Integration Tests**: 6 tests validating real DynamoDB operations
- **End-to-End Validation**: Complete save/retrieve/update/delete cycles tested
- **Environment Safety**: All tests use isolated test data with proper cleanup

### Patterns Established:

#### 1. **Integration Testing Pattern**
```python
# Dynamic resource discovery via SAM
@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def aws_resources(integration_config):
    resources = discover_stack_resources(stack_name, profile, region)
    return resources

# Environment-agnostic container setup
@pytest.fixture(scope="module")
def integration_container(integration_config, aws_resources):
    container = IrusContainer.create_production()
    container._session = boto3.session.Session(
        profile_name=integration_config['aws_profile'],
        region_name=integration_config['aws_region']
    )
    return container
```

#### 2. **Repository Testing Pattern**
```python
# CRUD round-trip validation
def test_crud_round_trip(self, repo):
    # Create → Save → Read → Update → Delete → Verify
    model = create_test_model()
    saved = repo.save(model)
    retrieved = repo.get_by_key(key)
    updated = repo.save(modified_model)
    repo.delete(key)
    assert repo.get_by_key(key) is None
```

#### 3. **Model Enhancement Pattern**
```python
# Pydantic validation with business logic
@field_validator("faction")
@classmethod
def validate_faction(cls, v: str) -> str:
    valid_factions = {"yellow", "purple", "green"}
    if v.lower() not in valid_factions:
        raise ValueError(f"Faction must be one of: {', '.join(valid_factions)}")
    return v.lower()
```

### Technical Validation Results:

✅ **All repositories work with real DynamoDB**: 100% CRUD success rate
✅ **Performance acceptable**: ~7 seconds for full CRUD cycles
✅ **Data integrity maintained**: No corruption or key conflicts
✅ **Pydantic serialization compatible**: All models serialize correctly to/from DynamoDB
✅ **Environment discovery working**: SAM CLI integration functional
✅ **Faction color system**: User-friendly faction representation implemented

### Quality Metrics:
- **Test Coverage**: 28.56% overall, 97.85% for MemberRepository, 68.29% for models
- **Integration Tests**: 6 passing tests covering all repositories
- **Unit Tests**: 40 passing tests with comprehensive mocking
- **Linting**: All pre-commit hooks passing (ruff, mypy, security checks)

#### Next Phase Ready:
- **Repository Pattern Validated**: Proven to work with real AWS infrastructure
- **Service Layer Refactoring**: Ready to proceed with `process.py`, `report.py`, `month.py` modernization
- **Clean Architecture**: Pure models + repository layer + container dependency injection established
