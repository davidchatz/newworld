# Project: Code Quality Foundation

## Overview
Modernize the `irus` package with type safety, comprehensive testing, and improved architecture to establish a solid foundation for future development. Convert core models to Pydantic, implement modern testing patterns, and improve code organization while maintaining Lambda layer compatibility.

## Context
- **Current State**: Mixed dataclasses/plain classes, limited type hints, sparse test coverage
- **Target State**: Pydantic models with full type safety, comprehensive test suite with mocking, clean architecture
- **Scope**: Focus on `src/layer/irus` package - Lambda functions addressed later
- **Branch**: All changes to be made on branch `rework-202509`

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- [x] All core models use Pydantic with full type annotations *(IrusMember, IrusInvasion completed - remaining models TBD)*
- [x] Comprehensive test suite with >90% coverage for models and services *(>95% coverage for completed models)*
- [x] Modern testing patterns: fixtures, parametrize, mocking for AWS services *(Pattern established with pytest)*
- [x] Clean separation of concerns: models, services, adapters *(Repository pattern established)*
- [x] Maintain Lambda layer deployment compatibility *(Backward compatibility pattern proven)*
- [x] All existing functionality preserved during refactor *(For completed models - pattern established)*

### Technical Requirements
- [x] Add Pydantic as project dependency *(Already available in environment)*

- [ ] Add Pydantic and modern testing dependencies to project
- [ ] Configure pytest with modern patterns and fixtures
- [ ] Set up test coverage reporting and CI integration
- [ ] **REVIEW POINT**: User review and approval of Phase 1 changes

### Phase 2: Package Restructure (Optional - Defer if Complex)
- [ ] Evaluate current vs proposed structure (models/services/adapters)
- [ ] Create new directory structure if beneficial
- [ ] Move files and update imports systematically
- [ ] Update `__init__.py` to maintain API compatibility
- [ ] **REVIEW POINT**: User review and approval of Phase 2 changes

### Phase 3: Core Models Modernization with Repository Pattern
**Architecture Decision**: Implement Repository Pattern to separate data models from AWS resource access, enabling proper unit testing and clean architecture.

#### Phase 3A: Pure Pydantic Models
- [x] Convert `IrusMember` to pure Pydantic model (no AWS calls) ✅ *COMPLETED*
- [x] Convert `IrusInvasion` to pure Pydantic model with validation ✅ *COMPLETED*
- [ ] Convert remaining model classes (`IrusLadderRank`, `IrusLadder`, etc.) to pure models
- [x] Ensure all models are pure data objects with validation only *(Pattern established)*

#### Phase 3B: Repository Layer Implementation
- [x] Create `repositories/` directory structure ✅ *COMPLETED*
- [x] Implement `MemberRepository` with all CRUD operations ✅ *COMPLETED*
- [x] Implement `InvasionRepository` with query methods ✅ *COMPLETED*
- [ ] Implement `LadderRepository` for ranking data
- [x] Create base `Repository` class for common patterns ✅ *COMPLETED*

#### Phase 3C: Service Layer Refactoring
**Architecture Decision**: Use Global Container Pattern with Constructor Flexibility for backward compatibility and testability.

- [ ] Update service classes to use repositories instead of direct model calls
- [ ] Refactor `process.py` to use repository pattern
- [ ] Refactor `report.py` and `month.py` for repository access
- [x] Maintain backward compatibility in public APIs *(Pattern established with facades)*

**Implementation Pattern**:
```python
class ServiceClass:
    def __init__(self, container: Optional[IrusContainer] = None):
        self._container = container or IrusContainer.default()

    @classmethod
    def from_method(cls, ..., container: Optional[IrusContainer] = None):
        instance = cls(container)
        # Use instance._container.repository_name() for data access
```

**Benefits**: Backward compatible (no Lambda function changes), testable (can inject test container), follows established repository pattern.

#### Phase 3D: Comprehensive Testing
- [x] Write unit tests for pure models (validation, serialization) ✅ *COMPLETED*
- [x] Write unit tests for repositories with mocked DynamoDB ✅ *COMPLETED*
- [ ] Write unit tests for service layer with mocked repositories (90%+ coverage)
- [ ] Write selective integration tests for S3 operations only (3-5 critical paths)
- [x] Achieve >90% test coverage for models and repositories *(>95% for completed models)*
- [x] **REVIEW POINT**: User review and approval of Phase 3 changes ✅ *COMPLETED*

**Testing Strategy Decision**:
- **Unit Tests**: Mock repositories for fast, comprehensive business logic testing
- **Integration Tests**: Target S3 operations only, avoid expensive Textract tests
- **Coverage Goal**: 90%+ unit test coverage, selective integration validation

#### Phase 3E: DynamoDB Integration Validation
**Purpose**: Validate repository pattern with real DynamoDB before proceeding with service layer refactoring.

- [ ] Create minimal integration test suite for DynamoDB operations
- [ ] Test `MemberRepository` CRUD operations against dev environment DynamoDB

- [ ] **REVIEW POINT**: User review and approval of integration test results

**Success Criteria**:
- All repositories can successfully save/retrieve data from DynamoDB
- Pydantic serialization is compatible with existing DynamoDB schema
- No data corruption or key conflicts with legacy data
- Performance is acceptable for basic CRUD operations

**Test Scope**: 3-5 focused integration tests covering basic CRUD round-trips, not comprehensive end-to-end scenarios.

### Phase 4: Service Layer & Adapters

## Dependencies
- Completed environment-aware resource naming (Project 02)
- Modern tooling foundation established (Project 01)
- Access to AWS services for integration testing
- Understanding of current model usage patterns

## Architecture Decision: Repository Pattern

### Problem
The current architecture has models tightly coupled to AWS resources:
- Models import `environ.py` → AWS resource initialization at import time
- Direct AWS calls in model methods (`table.put_item()`, `table.get_item()`)
- Impossible to unit test without AWS credentials and resources
- Violates Dependency Inversion Principle

### Solution: Repository Pattern
- **Pure Models**: Pydantic models with only data validation, no AWS calls
- **Repository Layer**: Separate classes handle all database operations
- **Dependency Injection**: Repositories can be mocked for testing
- **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns

### Benefits
- **Testable**: Models become pure data objects, easily unit tested
- **Maintainable**: Clear separation between data and persistence logic
- **Future-proof**: Easy to swap DynamoDB for other storage solutions
- **AWS SDK v2 Ready**: Isolated changes when AWS APIs evolve

## Risks & Considerations
- Large refactor could introduce subtle bugs - comprehensive testing essential
- Pydantic may change serialization behavior - validate carefully
- Performance impact of Pydantic validation in Lambda environment
- Breaking changes to internal APIs require careful coordination
- **CRITICAL**: Maintain backward compatibility for Lambda functions during transition
- **NEW**: Repository pattern adds indirection - ensure performance testing
- **NEW**: More complex dependency management - document injection patterns

## Notes
- Focus on `irus` package only - Lambda functions updated in future project
- Prioritize models over services - establish patterns then apply consistently
- Use modern Python patterns (3.11+ features where beneficial)
- Consider async patterns for future AWS SDK v2 migration
- Document architectural decisions for future team members

- **Environment Safety**: All tests use isolated test data with proper cleanup

### Patterns Established:

#### 1. **Integration Testing Pattern**
```python
# Dynamic resource discovery via SAM
@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def aws_resources(integration_config):
    resources = discover_stack_resources(stack_name, profile, region)
    return resources

# Environment-agnostic container setup
@pytest.fixture(scope="module")
def integration_container(integration_config, aws_resources):
    container = IrusContainer.create_production()
    container._session = boto3.session.Session(
        profile_name=integration_config['aws_profile'],
        region_name=integration_config['aws_region']
    )
    return container
```

#### 2. **Repository Testing Pattern**
```python
# CRUD round-trip validation
def test_crud_round_trip(self, repo):
    # Create → Save → Read → Update → Delete → Verify
    model = create_test_model()
    saved = repo.save(model)
    retrieved = repo.get_by_key(key)
    updated = repo.save(modified_model)
    repo.delete(key)
    assert repo.get_by_key(key) is None
```

#### 3. **Model Enhancement Pattern**
```python
# Pydantic validation with business logic
@field_validator("faction")
@classmethod
def validate_faction(cls, v: str) -> str:
    valid_factions = {"yellow", "purple", "green"}
    if v.lower() not in valid_factions:
        raise ValueError(f"Faction must be one of: {', '.join(valid_factions)}")
    return v.lower()
```

## Legacy Code Analysis (September 2024)

### Code Modernization Status:
**Total Legacy Code**: ~1,347 lines (22% of codebase)
- **Pure legacy**: 109 lines (2%) - `posttable.py` (55 lines) + `imageprep.py` (54 lines)
- **Facades**: 1,054 lines (18%) - Backward compatibility wrappers
- **Thin wrappers**: 18 lines (<1%) - `utilities.py`
- **Infrastructure**: 184 lines (3%) - `environ.py` (unchanged by design)

**Total Modern Code**: ~4,727 lines (78% of codebase)
- **Pure Models**: 1,027 lines - Pydantic models with validation
- **Repository Layer**: 1,108 lines - Clean data access patterns
- **Service Layer**: 1,253 lines - Business logic with dependency injection
- **Infrastructure**: 339 lines - Container pattern

### Remaining Work:
Only **109 lines (2%)** of pure legacy code remain in `posttable.py` and `imageprep.py`. The facade files provide backward compatibility and can remain indefinitely without blocking modernization goals.

---

## Phase 4: Utility Services Modernization (IN PROGRESS)

**Objective**: Modernize remaining utility classes using clean service architecture patterns

### Current Assessment:

#### **Files Requiring Modernization:**

**High Priority - Core Business Logic:**
1. **`posttable.py`** (0% coverage)
   - **Issue**: Import-time resource initialization, poor naming
   - **Contains**: Discord message chunking and Step Function workflow
   - **Usage**: Discord bot for posting table data

2. **`utilities.py`** (0% coverage)
   - **Issue**: Standalone functions with complex business logic
   - **Contains**: `update_invasions_for_new_member()` - updates ladder membership flags
   - **Usage**: Member onboarding workflow

3. **`imageprep.py`** (38% coverage)
   - **Issue**: Mixed S3 operations with image processing logic
   - **Contains**: OCR preprocessing (grayscale, contrast, sharpen, invert)
   - **Usage**: Textract image preprocessing pipeline

**Medium Priority - Legacy Facades:**
4. **`ladder.py`** (37% coverage) - Complex legacy methods not fully migrated
5. **`ladderrank.py`** (57% coverage) - Direct DynamoDB operations remain
6. **`invasion.py`** (57% coverage) - Some AWS calls still present
7. **`member.py`** (57% coverage) - Legacy methods need final cleanup

### Proposed Service Architecture:

#### **1. Discord Messaging Service**
Replace `IrusPostTable` with clean service architecture:

```python
class DiscordMessagingService:
    """Service for posting formatted messages to Discord via webhooks."""

    def __init__(self, container: IrusContainer = None):
        self._container = container or IrusContainer.default()
        self._step_machine = self._container.state_machine()

    def post_table_data(self, interaction_id: str, token: str,
                       table_data: list[str], title: str) -> str:
        """Post table data as chunked Discord messages."""

# Supporting utility
class MessageFormatter:
    """Pure utility for formatting messages within Discord limits."""

    @staticmethod
    def chunk_table_for_discord(table: list[str], title: str,
                               max_length: int = 1995) -> list[str]:
        """Split table into Discord-compatible message chunks."""
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Clear naming and responsibility
- ✅ Container-based dependency injection
- ✅ Testable with mocked Step Functions
- ✅ Pure functions for message formatting

#### **2. Image Processing Service**
Replace `ImagePreprocessor` with separated concerns:

```python
class ImageProcessor:
    """Pure image processing operations (no I/O)."""

    def __init__(self, contrast_factor: float = 1.0, saturation_factor: float = 1.0):
        self.contrast_factor = contrast_factor
        self.saturation_factor = saturation_factor

    def preprocess_for_ocr(self, image_data: bytes) -> bytes:
        """Apply OCR-optimized preprocessing to image data."""

class S3ImageService:
    """Service for S3 image operations with preprocessing."""

    def __init__(self, container: IrusContainer = None):
        self._container = container or IrusContainer.default()
        self._s3 = self._container.s3()
        self._processor = ImageProcessor()

    def preprocess_s3_image(self, bucket: str, key: str) -> str:
        """Download, process, and upload image."""
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Pure image processing (easily testable)
- ✅ S3 operations through container
- ✅ Configurable processing pipeline
- ✅ Single responsibility principle

#### **3. Member Management Service**
Replace `utilities.py` functions with domain service:

```python
class MemberManagementService:
    """Service for member-related business operations."""

    def __init__(self, container: IrusContainer = None):
        self._container = container or IrusContainer.default()
        self._member_repo = MemberRepository(container)
        self._ladder_repo = LadderRepository(container)

    def update_member_ladder_history(self, member: IrusMember) -> str:
        """Update member flag in all ladder entries since join date."""
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Repository pattern for data access
- ✅ Business logic encapsulation
- ✅ Container-based dependencies
- ✅ Comprehensive unit testing

### Architecture Principles:

#### **Service Design Patterns:**
1. **Container Injection**: All services use `IrusContainer` for dependencies
2. **Pure Functions**: Separate data transformation from I/O operations
3. **Single Responsibility**: Each service has one clear purpose
4. **Repository Access**: All data operations through repository layer
5. **Factory Methods**: Common service configurations via class methods

#### **Testing Strategy:**
1. **Pure Function Testing**: Direct unit tests for formatters/processors
2. **Service Mocking**: Container injection enables repository mocking
3. **Integration Points**: Focused tests for AWS service integration
4. **Business Logic**: Comprehensive coverage of domain operations

### Success Criteria:
- [ ] All utility classes follow container injection pattern
- [ ] Pure functions separated from I/O operations
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage for new service classes
