# Project: Test Coverage Expansion

## Overview
Expand unit and integration test coverage for the modernized codebase, fix existing test failures, and reduce dependency on legacy end-to-end tests. Focus on comprehensive testing of the modern architecture including models, repositories, services, and facades while maintaining separation from Lambda/Step Function infrastructure.

## Context
- **Current State**: 413 modern tests with some failures, 3 broken legacy end-to-end tests, good coverage for models but gaps in integration testing
- **Target State**: All modern tests passing, comprehensive unit and integration test coverage, legacy tests superseded by modern equivalents
- **Scope**: Focus on `tests/` directory and modernized code in `src/layer/irus` - Lambda functions to be addressed in future projects
- **Branch**: All changes to be made on branch `rework-202509`

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- [ ] All existing modern tests pass without failures
- [ ] Legacy tests either superseded by modern equivalents or removed
- [ ] Comprehensive unit test coverage for all modernized services and facades
- [ ] Enhanced integration test coverage for repository operations
- [ ] Test coverage >95% for all modernized components
- [ ] All test failures in facades, repositories, and services resolved

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Fix test failures in integration tests (DynamoDB integration)
- [ ] Fix test failures in facade tests (ladder, ladderrank facades)
- [ ] Fix test failures in repository tests (ladder repository)
- [ ] Fix test failures in service tests (month service)
- [ ] Add missing unit tests for edge cases and error conditions
- [ ] Expand integration tests for complex workflows
- [ ] Ensure proper mocking for AWS services in unit tests

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] Test execution time remains reasonable (<2 minutes for full suite)
- [ ] Clear test organization and naming conventions
- [ ] Comprehensive test documentation for complex scenarios
- [ ] Proper test isolation and cleanup
- [ ] No test interdependencies or flaky tests

## Tasks
### Phase 1: Fix Existing Test Failures
- [ ] Fix integration test failures in DynamoDB tests
- [ ] Fix facade test failures in ladder and ladderrank facades
- [ ] Fix repository test failures in ladder repository
- [ ] Fix service test failures in month service
- [ ] Verify all modern tests pass reliably
- [ ] **REVIEW POINT**: User review of test fixes

### Phase 2: Expand Unit Test Coverage
- [ ] Add missing unit tests for service layer edge cases
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling tests for repositories
- [ ] Add validation tests for facade layers
- [ ] Add model interaction tests for complex workflows
- [ ] Ensure >95% coverage for all modernized components
- [ ] **REVIEW POINT**: User review of unit test expansion

### Phase 3: Enhance Integration Tests
- [ ] Add end-to-end workflow tests (without Lambda dependency)
- [ ] Add comprehensive DynamoDB integration scenarios
- [ ] Add cross-service integration tests
- [ ] Add performance and load testing for critical paths
- [ ] **REVIEW POINT**: User review of integration test enhancement

### Phase 4: Legacy Test Cleanup
- [ ] Identify functionality covered by legacy tests
- [ ] Create modern equivalents for useful legacy test scenarios
- [ ] Remove or archive legacy tests that are superseded
- [ ] Update test documentation and README
- [ ] **REVIEW POINT**: User review of legacy test cleanup

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All modern tests pass consistently
- [ ] Test coverage >95% for models, repositories, services, and facades
- [ ] No legacy test dependencies
- [ ] Clear test execution and debugging workflow
- [ ] Comprehensive test documentation

## Dependencies
- Project 03 (Code Quality Foundation) must be completed
- Modern architecture (models, repositories, services) must be stable
- Test infrastructure and mocking patterns established

## Risks and Considerations
- **Test Complexity**: Some integration tests may require complex AWS service mocking
- **Performance**: Expanded test suite may increase execution time
- **Maintenance**: More tests require ongoing maintenance as code evolves
- **Legacy Coverage**: Some legacy test scenarios may be difficult to reproduce in modern tests

## Success Metrics
- All 413+ modern tests passing
- Test coverage reports showing >95% coverage
- Zero test flakiness or intermittent failures
- Test execution time <2 minutes for full suite
- Clear documentation for running and debugging tests
